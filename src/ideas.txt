ink + control multiple entities.

ink in terms of contract signing.

I guess you play as a kind of company, making business decisions.

also play as a different company. 

ok, so the idea is to play as multiple companies. sign contracts between them 

manage multiple mutually interacting companies working towards their own goals, but can help each other.

compare build-a-lot and candy box 2 (NOT an idle game)

workers don't generate income  on their own, but you need them to do stuff.

a mining company (exports raw materials), a computer company (exports electronics), and a space exploration company (exports know-how/advance tech tree).

each company has their own resources and cash, and must buy/sell from other companies.

player has to adjust whether to sell to general public for money, or keep raw materials to send to other companies. 

how about we make it turn-based ? (daily stuff).

end goal is to create a mining company on the moon, advance a tech tree. 

player does not choose to send contracts, it happens automatically when certain conditions are met (it will show that). sometimes it's better to refuse.

contracts are, for example: allowing purchase of resources at all, allowing purchase at cheaper prices, collaborate to develop a new technology (only with space exploration company). 

contracts that are mandatory for progress - you can change your mind, but you need criteria met to be able to accept it.

"bad" contracts are with the government (too many workers, not enough funds), 

worker allocations: what to mine? which computer parts to make? what to research
